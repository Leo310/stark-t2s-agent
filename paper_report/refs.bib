abstract = {Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT are emerging as popular alternatives to traditional search engines for finding information online. However, their impact on user behavior and experience in everyday tasks is still unclear. We conducted a large-scale study (n = 1,526) with a diverse U.S. sample, using a custom-build software to track participants’ behavior during practical search tasks with either ChatGPT or Google. ChatGPT users compared to Google users were faster and more likely to find the correct answers. Nevertheless, participants expressed a subjective preference for Google, with ChatGPT preference more strongly dependent on users’ personality profiles. Importantly, ChatGPT users relied significantly less on primary web sources, suggesting it is more often seen as a one-stop solution rather than a connective hub for information retrieval. These findings provide key insights into the transformative effects of generative AI on everyday search, highlighting both its benefits and challenges for user interaction and trust.},

    abstract = "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components, existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose TableRAG, an SQL-based framework that unifies textual understanding and complex manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps: context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question answering."

abstract = {Enterprises generate vast amounts of unstructured documents, posing challenges for knowledge extraction and representation. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for processing such data but struggle with factual accuracy and provenance. Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a structured framework to address these limitations [6], yet constructing high-quality KGs from heterogeneous data remains a challenge. To address this issue, we present Docs2KG, a modular framework to build high-quality KGs from diverse unstructured documents. We first employs state-of-the-art document processing techniques to extract textual content, tabular data, and figures. The extracted information is then unified into a multifaceted KG with three aspects: (1) a Layout KG capturing document structural hierarchies, (2) a Metadata KG preserving document properties, and (3) a Semantic KG representing domain-specific entities and relationships. Docs2KG supports multiple construction paradigms for Semantic KG: ontology-based approaches, hybrid NLP pipelines with LLM verification, LLM-guided ontology generation, and specialized models for named entity recognition, event extraction, and causal relationship identification to enhance semantic coverage and accuracy. A key feature of Docs2KG is its human-in-the-loop verification interface, enabling iterative quality assessment and refinement of the resulting KGs. Docs2KG is openly available at https://docs2kg.ai4wa.com, with the aim of advancing knowledge graph construction research and accelerating enterprise applications through high-quality knowledge graph construction.},
